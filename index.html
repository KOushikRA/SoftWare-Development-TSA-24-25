                        Pollution has been a big problem in Georgia. There is trash on the side of practically every major road. an estimated 10,000 - 50,000
                    pounds are found in a single city alone. What makes it worse is that counties like Forsyth County do not even offer Curbside
                    Trash Pick-up. Throwing the trash in the bin does not make it any better. The average American household does not recycle plastic and ends up
                    throwing it in the trash. This trash ends up in landfills and garbage patches in the ocean. The U.S. contributes to 146.1 million tons of this trash.
                    All of this, however, can be avoided with just one simple solution. That is if people work together as a community.

    <p>
            One way of helping is by joining a local organization or even creating one with the cause of making the streets clean. There are many
        examples of such efforts. One of them is to adopt a road. There are many counties and cities in Georgia that follow the Adopt a Road 
        program which dedicates itself to Clearing up litter on the street and promoting Environmental responsibility. Another example of organizations
        that promote respectfulness in the environment is Team Seas and Team Trees. They are both led by Mrbeast, A social media influencer who has 
        the most subscribers on YouTube and uses his fame and money to help the environment. Team Trees, launched in 2019, dedicates itself to revert the 
        devastations of deforestation and improving air quality while Team Seas, launched in 2021, focuses itself on picking up 30 million pounds of trash off the ground.
